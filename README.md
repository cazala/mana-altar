# MANA ALTAR

Fees collected from the Marketplace are stored in this Altar.

Anyone can burn the MANA collected by touching the Altar's stone
and light the flame, which will last 1 block for every 10 MANA burnt.

You **MUST** be on mainnet for this in order to work

## Demo Mode

You can set the variable `DEMO_MODE` to `true` and the collected MANA will be 25,000 and you won't need to sign a transaction to push the burn button
